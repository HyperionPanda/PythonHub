# PythonHub
A hub, meant to store the python code on the computer and run it with simple commands


PythonHub.py is supposed to dynamically import, compile, and run any python code that it is given and allow for ease of access.
It currently does so by creating a file which can save the path of the python file. It then accesses that file and imports whichever
project is chosen by the user. In future, I hope to implement a GUI that can run this just by clicking on a button created for each 
project.


This project was created when I got interested in how dynamic importing would work. It is a bit useless since most people will have all of their python programs in one well-formatted place, but I wanted to be a bit lazy and be able to quickly run any program of my choosing quickly without having to go through the process of opening it up and running it myself.
