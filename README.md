# PythonHub
A hub, meant to store the python code on the computer and run it with simple commands

PythonHub.py is supposed to dynamically import, compile, and run any python code that it is given and allow for ease of access.

It currently does so by creating a file which can save the path of the python file. It then accesses that file and imports whichever

project is chosen by the user. In future, I hope to implement a GUI that can run this just by clicking on a button created for each 

project.
